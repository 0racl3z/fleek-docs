# Setting up ENS Domain

You can now easily point an ENS domain to your IPFS site and have the content automatically update for future deployments. Input your ENS domain and make one transaction, we’ll take care of it for you from there. We use the ENS smart contract’s “controller” role that keeps you in full control and ownership of your ENS domain, while you delegate the day to day operations to Fleek. Check out our Homepage on ENS! Whenever we make updates to our Homepage, Fleek handles updating the content to our ENS Domain.

# Deploying

Once your app is deployed on fleek go th=o the menu that says settings, a new set of menu would be listed by the left hand side, clicking Domain Management and scrolling a bit would land you on the section that says ENS
