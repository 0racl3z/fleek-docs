# Monitoring Your Site
Terminal offers a host of logging tools to aid in monitoring your site.

# Deploy Logs
The deploy log includes all of the standard output which comes from running your build as well as Terminal-specific information about dependency caching, Terminal configuration file processing, and more.

# Deploy Summaries

You can find a deploy summary on the detail page of any successful deploy, right above the deploy log. It allows you to quickly identify your deploy status and refer to the details in the log based on different types of information.
