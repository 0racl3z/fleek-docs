## Fleek DNS
Fleek also can handle DNS management to allow for adding custom domains.
## Custom Domains
 Upon site creation, Fleek will automatically assign a domain name in the following follow: [RANDOM_NAME].on.fleek.co.
 Of course, we allow users to point the site to a custom of their choice.

### Adding a Custom Domain 

![](/images/addCustomDomain.png)

1. Go to your site's page and select `Add or register domain`
2. Enter the domain you would like to add
3. From here you will either have to confirm that you already own this domain. If you do not own the domain name and that it is available, you can buy it through Fleek.

### Verifying the Custom Domain
After adding the custom domain, it will appear in the site's settings under `Domain Management` > `Domains`.

The domain must be verified before it is linked to the site. To verify, click on the `Check DNS configuration` button. This will make a modal appear containing instructions to add the domain.
Follow the instructions in the modal. The steps to update the records might be slightly different depending on your domain name provider.
We then must wait for the domain to be propagated before clicking on `Verify DNS configuration` on the modal.

To verify that the DNS is indeed propagated before clicking on the button, you can use a tool such as <https://dnschecker.org/>

If the verify DNS was successful, the domain name will become blue.

## HTTPS (SSL)
Fleek offers HTTPS on all sites using the SSL protocol 
Fleek automatically manages certificate creation and renewal. Your certificate will include all your domain names when it's issued, but note that the DNS also needs to be configured in advance for each alias for us to include them on your certificate.

## Definitions
The domain name (or domain for short): the full name used to access a site. For example, yoursitename.fleek.co or www.yourcustomdomain.com Apex domain (also known as root, bare, or naked domain): the yourcustomdomain.com part in www.yourcustomdomain.com.
* Subdomain: a domain that is part of a larger domain; the only domain that is not also a subdomain is the apex domain. For example, www.yourcustomdomain.com and app.yourcustomdomain.com are subdomains of yourcustomdomain.com.
* Fleek subdomain: Fleek term for the default domain with the form [name-of-your-site].Fleek.co gave to each site.
* Custom domain: a non-Fleek domain assigned to a site.
* Primary domain: Fleek term for the main custom domain assigned to a site.
* Domain alias: Fleek term for additional custom domains assigned to a site.
* Domain registrar (or domain registration service): company that lets you register a domain name.
* DNS provider: a company that maintains the DNS servers that translate a domain name to a destination.
* Fleek DNS: Fleek's managed DNS service.
* Nameserver (or DNS server): a specialized server that translates domain names into IP addresses.
* DNS zone: provides information about one or more domain names. Each zone contains a list of DNS records with mappings between domain names and IP addresses.

# Setting up ENS

## Overview

You can now easily point an ENS domain to your IPFS site and have the content automatically update for future deployments. Here is how to set up an ENS domain for your site:

## Deploying

Once your app is deployed on fleek, go to the settings page in the left-hand bar menu click`Domain Management` and scrolling a bit would land you on the section that says `ENS`

## Adding ENS Domain

Click Add ENS to add your ENS domain. Input your domain to verify it and add it. If the domain does not belong to anyone you will be redirected to the [ENS Dashboard](https://app.ens.domains) to buy it.

NOTE: Your domain will appear in the settings page and can also be deleted from there.

## Set Fleek as the Controller

Fleek needs to be a controller of your ENS domain so we can automatically update your domain content hash when a site deployment succeeds. Click the `Set Fleek as Controller` button to set this up.

![](/images/ens3.png)

If the domain is using the old ENS resolver, you will be prompted to migrate to the latest resolver. By clicking on the `Migrate` button, you will be redirected to the [ENS Dashboard](https://app.ens.domains) to complete the migration.

Finally, clicking on the `Set Fleek as controller` button, will trigger a modal to connect an Ethereum web3 provider, such as [metamask](https://metamask.io/). If using metamask, a popup will appear asking to connect. After, another popup will appear to accept the Ethereum transaction to set Fleek as controller.

On the Settings section, the domain will show that the Ethereum transaction is pending confirmation. Upon confirmation, the ENS domain will have been successfully added to Fleek.
