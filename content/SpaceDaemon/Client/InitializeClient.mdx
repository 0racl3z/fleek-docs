#### Initialize client
> Before initializing the client, you need to have the [space-daemon](https://github.com/FleekHQ/space-daemon) up and running.


Please have in mind that [daemon](https://github.com/FleekHQ/space-daemon) only supports local connections for now, that means that you just can connect through your localhost. You can't connect through a dns or try to connect to a [daemon](https://github.com/FleekHQ/space-daemon) running on a different machine.

```js
  import { SpaceClient } from '@fleekhq/space-client';

  // default port exposed by the daemon for client connection is 9998
  const client = new SpaceClient({
    url: `http://0.0.0.0:9998`,
  });

  ...
```

If you are running the client on the server-side, you need to declare `XMLHttpRequest` module as global. (this is because client is based on [grpc-web](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grpc-web), which is supposed to be used on client-side).

install `XMLHttpRequest`

```bash
  yarn add xmlhttprequest
```

Or using npm

```bash
  npm install xmlhttprequest
```


then to initialize the client:

```js
  global.XMLHttpRequest = require("xmlhttprequest").XMLHttpRequest;

  const { SpaceClient } = require('@fleekhq/space-client');

  // default port exposed by the daemon for client connection is 9998
  const client = new SpaceClient({
    url: `http://0.0.0.0:9998`,
  });

  ...
