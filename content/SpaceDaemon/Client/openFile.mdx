#### .openFile({ path: string, bucket: string })

Copies the file referenced by the path arg to a temp folder and returns a Promise that resolves to the file location

```js
const asyncFunc = async () => {
  const bucket = 'my-bucket';

  const dirRes = await client.listDirectories({
    bucket,
  });

  const entriesList = dirRes.getEntriesList();

  const openFileRes = await client.openFile({
    bucket,
    path: entriesList[0].getPath(),
  });

  const location = openFileRes.getLocation();
  console.log(location); // "/path/to/the/copied/file"
};
```
