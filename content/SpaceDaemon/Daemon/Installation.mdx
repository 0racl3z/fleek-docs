## Installation

By default, Space Daemon connects to hosted services provided by Fleek. This should be good if you just want to get it running quickly. However, if you want to connect to your own services, read the [Modules Section](https://github.com/FleekHQ/space-daemon#Modules).

### Downloading the binary

Check out the releases [here](https://github.com/FleekHQ/space-daemon/releases/tag). You can download the latest version for your OS and you should be good to go.
