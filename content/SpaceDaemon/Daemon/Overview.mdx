# Space Daemon

Space Daemon is a wrapper built in Go around awesome IPFS tools so that you can have start coding a decentralized desktop app as fast as possible. It's built on top of Textile Threads and Buckets. Out of the box it includes:

- A running local instance of [Textile Threads](https://github.com/textileio/go-threads).

- Interfaces to create local private, encrypted buckets.

- Interfaces for sharing those buckets and the files within.

- Identity service so that sharing can be done through usernames or emails.

- FUSE for drive mounting, so that the files can be explored natively in your OS.

- Key management.

Note: This project is in active development, so it might change its API until it reaches a stable version.
