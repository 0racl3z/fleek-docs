# Welcome to the Fleek Storage App!

# Overview

Upload, browse, and manage all your files through the app interface. All files uploaded are published to IPFS and published to DNS, with a CDN and File Compression. You can view and reference the files through the Fleek Storage URL, and can view directly on the IPFS gateway.

The Fleek Storage app is a tool meant to host public web assets.
