# View the Bucket, Folders, or Files

You can view your bucket, folders, or files via the Fleek Storage URL or directly on the IPFS gateway

Viewing the folder or file on the Fleek Storage URL will boast the benefits of the built in CDN, file compression, and image resizing. Clicking on the Bucket or folder URL can also navigate further into the bucket or folders.
