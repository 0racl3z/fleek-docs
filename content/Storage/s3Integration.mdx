# Simple AWS S3 integration with Fleek Storage!

Fleek provides everything you need to securely store files on IPFS and distribute them for the web applications.

Our Storage SDK allows developers to easily integrate our storage solution through the widely used AWS S3 interface.

### Get Started

You can get started with Storage SDK by first generating your api key and secret and creating an S3 instance.

- [Getting an Api Key](/Storage/s3Integration/GettingApiKeys)
- [Creating an S3 client instance](/Storage/s3Integration/CreatingAClientInstance)

The Fleek docs showcases some commonly used commands, but the AWS S3 documentation provides a more exhaustive account.
