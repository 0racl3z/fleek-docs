title: Creating an S3 Client

# Creating an S3 Client Instance
In order to use any of the SDK's command, we must generate an instance of the S3 client.

First, we must install the dependencies.

`npm  init`

`npm install --save   aws-sdk `

Then, we can declare the S3 client. You must replace [[apiKey]] and [[apiSecret]] with your [Api Key and Secret](/StorageSDK/GettingApiKeys).

    const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
   
    const s3 = new AWS.S3({
        apiVersion: '2006-03-01',
        accessKeyId: '[[apiKey]]',
        secretAccessKey: '[[apiSecret]]',
        endpoint: 'https://storageapi.fleek.co',
        region: 'us-east-1',
        s3ForcePathStyle: true
     });

Commands can then be called from the S3 client. EG: `s3.putObject()`.
