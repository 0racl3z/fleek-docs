title: Fetching File from Hash

---

Files stored in Fleek Storage can be fetched from any IPFS gateway with the IPFS hash, either from a web browser or through a CURL command.

From Fleek's IPFS gateway, the url is as follows: `http://ipfs.fleek.co/ipfs/<hash>`.

From the official IPFS gateway, the url is as follows: `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/<hash>`.

Beyond that, many companies offer IPFS gateways, such as [Cloudflare](https://developers.cloudflare.com/distributed-web/ipfs-gateway/) and [Infura](https://infura.io/docs/ipfs).

Of course, CURL commands will work as usual when fetching from a gateway.

```
curl https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmaisz6NMhDB51cCvNWa1GMS7LU1pAxdF4Ld6Ft9kZEP2a
```

Finally, files can be accessed without relying on third-party gateways through running an [IPFS node](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs).
