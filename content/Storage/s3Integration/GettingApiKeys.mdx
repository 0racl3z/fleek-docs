# Getting the API key

## From the Fleek CLI

The [Fleek CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fleekhq/fleek-cli) is a tool that allows access to Fleek's products from the command line.

### Installation

`npm install -g @fleekhq/fleek-cli`

Run the following command:

`fleek login`

It should open a browser window prompting you to log in. If you are already logged in, it will automatically close the browser window and generate the keys.

Next, run the command

`fleek  whoami`

Take note of the fields apiKey and apiSecret which will be needed in the next step.

### From the Web app

You can also generate a new api key from the Web app at [app.fleek.co](https://app.fleek.co).

The api generator is located in the user settings.

The new keys can be generated in the api section by clicking on `Create API keys`.
Make sense to copy the secret somewhere because it is only visible once.
