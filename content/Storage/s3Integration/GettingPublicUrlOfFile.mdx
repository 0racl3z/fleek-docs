title: Getting the public URL of a file

---

Fleek generates a public url for every file uploaded to Fleek Storage.

This url is derived from the name of the [bucket name](/Storage/s3Integration/FetchingBuckets) and the [file's key](/Storage/s3Integration/ListingTheContentOfBucket) and is formatted as follows:

`https://<bucket-name>.storage.fleek.co/<file-key>`
