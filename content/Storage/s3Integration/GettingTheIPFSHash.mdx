title: Getting the IPFS Hash

---

Fleek Storage leverages the power of IPFS. As such, all files in Fleek Storage are on IPFS and have a corresponding IPFS hash, also called a CID.

# Getting the IPFS hash from http headers of putObject
Fleek will insert the ifps hash of files in the http headers of the `putObject` command, used for [file upload](/StorageSDK/UploadingFiles).

By default, we give a v1 base32 CID. However, users can also retrieve the v0 CID which is shorter and is therefore cheaper to store on public blockchains.

```
  const request = s3.putObject(params);

  request.on('httpHeaders', (statusCode, headers) => {
    const ipfsHash = headers['x-fleek-ipfs-hash'];
    // Do stuff with ifps hash....
    const ipfsHashV0 = headers['x-fleek-ipfs-hash-v0'];
    // Do stuff with the short v0 ipfs hash... (appropriate for storing on blockchains)
  }).send();
```
