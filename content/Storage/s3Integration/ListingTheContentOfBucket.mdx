title: Listing Files in a Bucket

---

Files in a bucket can be listed provided an [S3 client instance](/StorageSDK/CreatingAClientInstance) and a [bucket name](/StorageSDK/FetchingBuckets).

    const params = {
         Bucket: "my-bucket",
         MaxKeys: 20
      };
 
    s3.listObjectsV2(params, function (err, data) {
         if (err) {
            console.log("Error when listing objects", err);
         } else {
            console.log("Success when listing objects", data);
         }
     });

An example of a typical response is provided below.

```
 { IsTruncated: false,
  Contents:
   [ { Key: 'hello-world.gif',
       LastModified: 2020-05-21T19:07:54.956Z,
       ETag: '"-1"',
       Size: 2078126,
       StorageClass: 'STANDARD',
       Owner: [Object] } ],
  Name: 'my-team-bucket',
  Prefix: '',
  Delimiter: '',
  MaxKeys: 20,
  CommonPrefixes: [],
  KeyCount: 1 }
```

Each file in Fleek Storage can be identified through the `Name` of the bucket that contains it and the fileâ€™s unique `Key`.
