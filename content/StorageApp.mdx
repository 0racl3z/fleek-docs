# Overview

Upload, browse, and manage all your files through the app interface. All files uploaded are published to IPFS and published to DNS, with a CDN and File Compression. You can view and reference the files through the Fleek Storage URL, and can view directly on the IPFS gateway.

# Upload Folders and Files

Go to the Storage page by selecting storage on the left-hand side navigation.

Click on the upload button to open the upload pop up.

Browse through your folders by clicking on the folder. Once you're in a folder the bucket URL will adjust to the route pointing to that folder, and this works the same for opening specific files.

### View the Bucket, Folders, or Files

You can view your bucket, folders, or files via the Fleek Storage URL or directly on the IPFS gateway

Viewing the folder or file on the Fleek Storage URL will boast the benefits of the built in CDN, file compression, and image resizing.
