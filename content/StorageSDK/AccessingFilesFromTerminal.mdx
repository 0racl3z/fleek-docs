title: Accessing Storage from Terminal

---

# Accessing from the Terminal
AWS also has tools for interacting with S3 from the terminal using AWS CLI. To do this, first install AWS CLI from https://aws.amazon.com/cli/

Then, configure the AWS CLI to point to Fleek Storage endpoint, replacing [[apiKey]] and [[apiSecret]] with the [Api Key and Secret](/StorageSDK/GettingApiKeys).

```
aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: [[apiKey]]
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: [[apiSecret]]
Default region name [None]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]: ENTER

```

To list your buckets, run the following command:

`aws --endpoint-url https://storageapi.fleek.co s3 ls`

To list objects within a bucket, run:

`aws --endpoint-url https://storageapi.fleek.co s3 ls s3://my-bucket`
