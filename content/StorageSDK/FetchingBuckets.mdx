Buckets are the containers in which files are stored.

# Accessing your bucket from code
The buckets associated with your account can be listed programatically through your [S3 client instance](/StorageSDK/CreatingAClientInstance).

    s3.listBuckets(function (err, data) {
        if (err) {
          console.log("Error when listing buckets", err);
        } else {
          console.log("Success when listing buckets", data);
        }
     });
