title: Uploading Files

---

You can upload files to a bucket with the `putObject` command through the [S3 Client](/StorageSDK/CreatingAClientInstance).
You must also specify the name of the [name of the bucket](/StorageSDK/FetchingBuckets) that will contain the file.

```
  const params = {
    Bucket: 'my-team-bucket',
    Key: 'folder/my-picture',
    ContentType: 'image/png',
    Body: myPictureFile,
    ACL: 'public-read',
  };

  const request = s3.putObject(params);
  request.send();
```

The IPFS hash of the file can be accessed through the HTTP Headers of the request.
