title: "Fleek's IPFS Gateway"
---

IPFS gateways allow you to access the IPFS network without running your own IPFS node. They are a convenient way of interacting with IPFS.

# Reading files
Fleek provides its own IPFS gateway that anyone can use to access files on IPFS, provided an IPFS hash (also called CID). Simply replace the `HASH` in the link below and enter the address in your web browser.

`https://ipfs.fleek.co/ipfs/HASH`

EG: For the hash `QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco`, the url would be <https://ipfs.fleek.co/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco> 

# Uploading files
It is important to take note that IPFS gateways are only for *reading* files and not uploading them.

In order to upload a file to IPFS, the best method is to do it through either the [Fleek Storage App](/StorageApp/Overview) or with code using [Fleek Storage Js](/FleekStorageJs/Overview).
