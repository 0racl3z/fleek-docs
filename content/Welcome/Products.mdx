# Our Producsts

Fleek leverages the [power of IPFS](/Welcome/WhatIsIPFS) alongside intuitive user interfaces to grant users access to next-generation technologies in the most accessible manner possible.

## Fleek Sites
[Fleek Sites](/Sites) is a powerful and modern web hosting solution in which websites are stored on IPFS.

Our intuitive user interface makes it painless to deploy a site.

We automatically detect popular frameworks and provide the correct configurations.

Also, a free domain name is provided and we give the option to use custom domains.

Fleek sites is also perfect for Web3 developers since they can easily set up an automated workflow that syncs with an ENS domain. However, the simplicity of our deployment process means that any website can be easily deployed with Fleek.

## Fleek Storage
Fleek Storage allows users to store files on IPFS. This solution is useful for the distribution of web assets on websites.

We provide an intuitive [web application](/Storage/StorageApp) so that the process is as painless as possible.

Alternatively, developers can use [Fleek Storage Js](/Storage/FleekStorageJs) to leverage Fleek Storage in their applications.

Are you using AWS s3 and want to migrate to Fleek Storage with minimal effort? Check out our [Fleek AWS s3 integration](/Storage/s3Integration).
