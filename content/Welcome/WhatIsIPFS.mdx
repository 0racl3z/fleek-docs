# What is IPFS?

IPFS is the new internet.

It is a peer-to-peer solution for the distribution of files on the internet and meant to be a replacement for HTTP.

Some of its advantages include:

* Greater speed and efficiency

* A more resilient internet

* Lower costs of operation

* Decentralisation and censorship-resistance

These features emerge from IPFS' foundational elements such as content addressing and a peer-to-peer network.

As the internet keeps on growing, some of HTTP's shortcomings are becoming increasingly evident and IPFS is the perfect solution for a flourishing internet.
