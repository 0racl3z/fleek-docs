# Welcome To Fleek 

Fleek provides everything you need to launch and maintain fast, modern websites hosted on IPFS. Welcome to the new internet.

### Get Started

Get started with Fleek by deploying your first website. The quickest way to begin is by connecting your website's GitHub repository to deploy directly from there and allow for continuous deployment. If you so choose, you can also deploy by uploading the full codebase for your website.
