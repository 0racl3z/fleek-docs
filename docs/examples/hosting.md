We lead by example at Fleek. Our [homepage](https://fleek.co) is deployed on Fleek and is a great example of a beautiful, modern web page running on IPFS.

### Fleek Blog

Fleek Hosting works wonders with Blogs. The build process is triggered automatically with each new update so you do not have to worry about deployment. You just need to worry about creating the content for your blog.

Therefore, it is a no-brainer that [our blog](https://docs.fleek.co) is hosted on Fleek.

### Fleek Docs

The M. Night Shyamalan-esque twist of this story is that you were on an IPFS site hosted on Fleek all along!

Indeed, _docs.fleek.co_ is a great example of how you can easily deploy your documentation on IPFS with Fleek Hosting.
