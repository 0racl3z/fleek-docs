Fleek makes it easy to build and integrate privacy, encryption, and p2p functionality into your sites, web & native apps. Built on top of IPFS, Textile, & Filecoin, our suite of products allows you to effortlessly take advantage of the benefits of these new technologies. Build on the new Internet!

## Fleek Hosting

From local development to global deployment, Fleek is everything you need to host fast, modern sites & apps on IPFS. All in one seamless workflow. Deploy your site in a few quick clicks onto IPFS with a built in CDN for blazing fast performance.

!!! info

    When you deploy on Fleek your site will have an IPFS hash and future automatic deployments will also update the IPFS hash of your site. Your site comes with a CDN, free SSL certificate, and a Fleek preview URL. You can add Custom Domains, ENS Domains, Configure Deploy Previews, and more.

## Fleek Storage

Fleek storage is the easiest and most performant way to upload, pin, and fetch files on IPFS. For ease of use you can use the Fleek Application UI to manage files, our FleekJs SDK to easily interact programmatically, or our AWS S3 integration if youâ€™re already using S3. You get the fastest IPFS file storage performance with an augmented CDN, File compression, and Image Resizing all packaged up with the Fleek Storage URLs (ex: example-bucket.storage.fleek.co). All files uploaded are published to DNS and can be viewed and referenced via the Fleek Storage URL and/or directly on any IPFS gateway.

## Space Daemon

The Space Daemon packages together IPFS, Textile Threads/Buckets, and Textile Powergate (Filecoin) into one easy to install and JS interface to make it easy to build peer to peer and privacy focused apps. Installing the Space Daemon is easy and comes with all the tools packaged together including IPFS and Textile nodes, and and also exposes gRPC methods specific to the features you want for your app including: File Upload (encrypted), File Sharing, Filecoin Markets, and User Controlled Data. You can access same methods using our JS client, so you don't need to worry about gRCP calls.

## Fleek's IPFS Gateway

Fleek's provides its own IPFS gateway so that anyone can access files on IPFS. Simply replace `HASH` with the IPFS hash (also called CID) of your file and you are good to go.
