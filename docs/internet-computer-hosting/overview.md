# Overview

![](imgs/hero.png)

With Fleek, you can seamlessly deploy **static sites** to DFINITY's [Internet Computer](https://dfinity.org/) ('IC'). The entire deployment process, from front-end canister creation to cycle management is abstracted and automated so that you can build fast sites on IC trustless, permissionless, and open infrastructure in a couple clicks.

Furthermore, for the Internet Computer ecosystem, we provide the following tools:

- Fleek's Internet Computer Gateway
- Proxy/Service Worker Resolving Options
- Automatic Cycle Management

!!! info

    When you deploy a static site to the Internet Computer via Fleek, a front-end canister will be created, and updated automatically by Fleek with each deployment. You can choose to proxy your IC site via a service worker, connecting directly to the IC, or Fleek's seamless proxy. Everything is deployed to our CDN as a performance front, with free SSL certificate and preview URL. Currently, we support custom DNS & HNS domains on IC projects.

### An Alpha Product
It's important to note that this is an **Alpha product**, which we are building on top of the Internet Computer's Alpha/Testnet. It is an experimental and early version that will help anyone test and build sites, apps or Dapps on the Internet Computer, in preparation for the Mainnet Beta release.

When Mainnet Beta genesis arrives, all sites on the Internet Computer with Fleek will be migrated and redeployed to the Beta.

### Getting Started

Get started on the Internet Computer with Fleek! What do you need to get started? A GitHub repository with a static website (we're Jamstack-ready!) is the fastest way to get started, just link it to Fleek, customize your build settings (or let Fleek do it for you), and hit deploy. You can begin simple, with any Jamstack site!
